Use this to interpret whether the week in the data \n(e.g., 'week_start' and 'week_end') refers to *this week* or *the previous week*.\n\n- If today's date falls within the 'week_start' and 'week_end' range, refer to it as “this week.”\n- If today's date is after the 'week_end', refer to it as “last week.”\n- Avoid phrases like “past week” — always choose “this week” or “last week” based on the date logic.\n\nYour task is to write a short, engaging summary (3–4 paragraphs) that explains:\n- The overall market direction and key regional patterns in maize prices.\n- Why these movements matter to ordinary households — how they might affect \n  food spending, meal planning, or household budgeting.\n- End with **practical advice or market insights** to help households make better \n   shopping decisions — such as:\n   - Where prices are currently lowest (counties or regions with drops)\n   - When or where it might be best to buy in bulk\n   - How households can adjust (e.g., combining purchases, sourcing locally, or substituting)\n\nDecide the tone and opening paragraph style based on the national percentage change:\n- If prices **increased**, open with a line that captures household concern or financial pressure. \n  The tone should convey empathy and awareness of how rising costs affect family budgets — \n  for instance, acknowledging that shopping has become a little more expensive or that families \n  are adjusting their spending.\n- If prices **decreased**, open with a line that communicates relief or optimism, reflecting \n  how lower prices can ease household strain and stretch food budgets further.\n- If prices are **stable**, begin with a calm, observational tone noting that maize prices \n  have generally remained steady, offering predictability for households.\n\nKeep it conversational and grounded in everyday Kenyan experiences — think of a \nradio presenter or neighborhood market reporter explaining it in plain language. \nAvoid jargon, statistics overload, or financial buzzwords.\n\nWhen mentioning prices, always format them as “Ksh40” (no space between the \nsymbol and number). Avoid markdown or bullet points — just clear, flowing paragraphs.\n\nWrite as if you’re talking directly to one person who manages their family’s shopping — \nuse “you” and “your household” instead of “listeners” or “readers.”  \nAvoid generic greetings like “dear readers.” Keep it warm, practical, and personal.\n\"\"\"\n\n# --- Generate summary using OpenAI ---\nresponse = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",  # use lightweight, fast model\n    input=prompt,\n    store=True\n)\n\n# --- Display AI-generated insight ---\nprint(response.output_text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-14T12:07:35.893757Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-14T12:07:35.894052Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-14T12:07:47.201646Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-14T12:07:35.894030Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-14T12:07:47.200598Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"This week, we’re seeing a notable shift in dry maize prices that might have you feeling the pinch at the grocery store. The average retail price of maize has risen to Ksh62.14, marking an increase of 7.58% from last week's Ksh57.76. This upward trend can be concerning, as it directly affects how much you spend on staple foods for your family. With households trying to balance already tight budgets, this increase may lead you to reconsider your shopping habits or meal planning for the week ahead.\n\nLooking closer at regional prices, some counties are experiencing significant fluctuations. For instance, Kisumu has seen a sharp decrease in maize prices to Ksh50, a drop of over 21%, while Nairobi's prices have gone up to Ksh80, reflecting an increase of 5.79%. In Trans-Nzoia and Meru, prices have also risen but are still manageable, sitting at Ksh57.5 and Ksh55 respectively. This disparity means that while you might have to dig a little deeper for maize in some areas, there are savings to be found in places like Kisumu. \n\nThese price movements matter because they affect how you plan meals and manage your food budget. With rising prices elsewhere, families in some regions like Kisumu could consider stocking up on maize while it’s cheaper, helping stretch your food budget further. It might also be a good time to get creative with meal prep and consider local substitutes when maize prices are high — think about incorporating more beans or ugali made with cassava if maize is getting pricey.\n\nTo make the most of your shopping experience this week, consider visiting counties where prices have dipped, like Kisumu, for more affordable options. If you have the storage space, buying in bulk when prices are lower can save you money in the long run. And don’t hesitate to source locally; sometimes the freshest produce can be found right in your community, often at better prices than the supermarket. By staying informed and adjusting your approach to what’s available, you can still keep your household fed without breaking the bank.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":48},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# --- Your Gmail credentials ---\nsender_email = \"adrianjuliusaluoch@gmail.com\"\napp_password = \"hgsp doxa czgw mlly\" \n# app_password = 'rnki zhzk dhxe mfoc'\n\n# --- Recipients ---\n# Recipient list\nrecipients = [\n    \"adrianjulius04@gmail.com\",\n    \"adrianaluoch5@gmail.com\",\n    \"adrianaluoch12@gmail.com\"\n]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-14T11:54:13.009442Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-14T11:54:13.009830Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-14T11:54:13.014570Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-14T11:54:13.009803Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-14T11:54:13.013632Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loop through each recipient\nfor email in recipients:\n    msg = MIMEMultipart(\"alternative\")\n    msg[\"From\"] = f\"Adrian Julius Aluoch <{sender_email}>\"\n    msg[\"To\"] = email\n    msg[\"Subject\"] = \"Weekly Maize Market Brief\"\n\n    # Personalized email body\n    body = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"\"\nHi ,\n        \n{response.output_text}\n        \nBest regards,  \nAdrian Julius Aluoch\n        \"\"\")\n\n    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, \"plain\"))\n\n    # Send email\n    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(\"smtp.gmail.com\", 465) as server:\n        server.login(sender_email, app_password)\n        server.send_message(msg)\n\n    # Add Timer\n    time.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds before next email\n\n    # Print Message\n    print(f\"✅ Email sent successfully to ({email})\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-14T11:57:19.065415Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-14T11:57:19.065784Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-14T11:57:27.869665Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-14T11:57:19.065756Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-14T11:57:27.868675Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Email sent successfully to (adrianjulius04@gmail.com)\n✅ Email sent successfully to (adrianaluoch5@gmail.com)\n✅ Email sent successfully to (adrianaluoch12@gmail.com)\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":46}]}
